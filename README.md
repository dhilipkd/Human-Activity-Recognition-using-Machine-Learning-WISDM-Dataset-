# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Machine-Learning-WISDM-Dataset-
This project implements an **end-to-end Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** system using Machine Learning on accelerometer sensor data from the **WISDM dataset**.   The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit** to enable real-time activity prediction.
